## My process

- Thought about how every element of the page fits
- Wrote HTML
- Had the card respond properly to resizing
- A lot of time spent thinking how can image ignore padding of the card for mobile view; without using positioning
  - Used `translate` and `100vw`
- Bullet points; had to use custom bullets with `flexbox`
- The rest I adjusted until it felt right

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Transition

### What I learned

- How to use transitions
- Custom bullet points
- How to make better responsive design
- Using tables

### Continued development

- Still a lot of things
